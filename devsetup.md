# Devlopment environment setup

The repository uses the play framework for the back-end.
Play is a scala based web framework.
We use the very good [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/tutorial/index.html) tool to manage compilation and other development tasks.

## Install sbt

To install sbt, we recommend following the [manual installation method from the sbt website](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/tutorial/Manual-Installation.html).
This ensures that you get the latest version of sbt, as package repository version are often out of date.
Once you've installed sbt you can try it out with a [hello world](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/tutorial/Hello.html) example.
